# User Notes Application

The User Notes Application is a web-based system that allows users to sign up, sign in, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes. The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.

## Features

- **User Registration (Sign-Up):** Users can create an account by providing a unique username, email, and password. User information is securely stored in a database, and passwords are hashed for security.

- **User Authentication (Sign-In):** Registered users can sign in by providing their email and password. The application verifies user credentials and issues a JWT for authentication.

- **Create, Read, Update, and Delete Notes:** Users can manage their notes by creating new notes, viewing a list of their notes, editing existing notes, and deleting notes.

## Technology Stack

- Node.js: Server-side runtime environment.
- Express.js: Web application framework.
- Mongoose: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user information and notes.
- bcrypt: Library for hashing user passwords.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Used for user authentication and securing API endpoints.
